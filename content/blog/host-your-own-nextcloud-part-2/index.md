### Install PHP

Nextcloud relies on PHP as its backend language, so the PHP runtime must be installed to execute its server-side code.

Official Debian and Ubuntu repositories prioritize stability, so they often provide older PHP versions and donâ€™t include very new releases like PHP 8.3 yet. To install the latest PHP versions, you need to add a trusted third-party repository like SURY (for Debian and Ubuntu), which maintains up-to-date PHP packages. Without adding this repo, apt wonâ€™t find PHP 8.3.

So add the SURY GPG key:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/php.gpg https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg
```

Then add the SURY repo:

```bash {lang=bash}
echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list
```

Update your local package list:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo apt update
```

We need to install a bunch of packages:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo apt install php8.3 php8.3-fpm php8.3-mysql php-common php8.3-cli php8.3-common php8.3-opcache php8.3-readline php8.3-mbstring php8.3-xml php8.3-gd php8.3-curl php-imagick php8.3-zip php8.3-xml php8.3-bz2 php8.3-intl php8.3-bcmath php8.3-gmp
```

One of the most important packages is `php-fpm`. It's a server-side daemon that manages a pool of worker processes to efficiently handle multiple PHP requests in parallel, improving performance and scalability for web applications.

Now start the fpm-service and enable it on startup:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo systemctl start php8.3-fpm && sudo systemctl enable php8.3-fpm
```

**Optimize PHP**

To enhance both the performance and security of your serverâ€™s PHP installation, you need to configure the `php.ini` file.

You can use any text editor you prefer, such as nano or vim.
I personally choose vim because itâ€™s a powerful tool â€” once mastered, it offers a fast and efficient editing experience. If you want to dive into it, [check out this post.]()

Open the file with:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo vim /etc/php/8.3/fpm/php.ini
```

It really depends on your specific needs, but as a solid starting point, I recommend the following settings:

**Resource limits**

```bash {lang=bash}
memory_limit = 512M
upload_max_filesize = 4G ; Maximum size of an uploaded file
post_max_size = 4G ; Maximum data size of a POST request. Should be >= to upload_max_filesize
max_execution_time = 3600 ; Time allowed to receive and parse incoming data (like file uploads)
max_input_time = 3600 ; Time allowed for the PHP script to run after data is received.
```

<div class="msg dyn">
PHP settings only affect uploads via the web interface. The Nextcloud Desktop Client avoids PHP timeouts by uploading large files in chunks over persistent connections â€” making it better for uploading something like a 30â€¯GB ZIP file for instance.
</div>

**Other**

```bash {lang=bash}
date.timezone = Europe/Berlin ; depends on your server location
```

**Enable OPCache**

Drastically improves PHP performance. Normally, when PHP runs a script, it parses and compiles it into bytecode every single time. OPcache skips that by caching the compiled version.

```bash {lang=bash}
opcache.enable = 1
opcache.memory_consumption = 128
opcache.interned_strings_buffer = 8
opcache.max_accelerated_files = 10000
opcache.revalidate_freq = 1
opcache.validate_timestamps = 1
```

**Security**

This setting makes sure PHP only runs real script files, not guessed ones â€” which helps keep your server safe, especially with Nginx.

```bash {lang=bash}
cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0
```

After making your changes, press `Esc` to change to Normal mode, then type `:wq` to save and exit the vim-editor.

### Configure Nginx

Create a new Nginx config file for Nextcloud:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud
```

This will open a new file where you can add the Nginx configuration for your Nextcloud setup.

Weâ€™ll start with a minimal HTTP-only setup where Nginx handles file routing and passes PHP requests to PHP-FPM. In the next post, weâ€™ll explore the full architecture and I explain why this approach is useful:

```bash {lang=bash, title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud"}
upstream php-handler {
    server unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    root /var/www/nextcloud;
    index index.php index.html;
    client_max_body_size 5G ; equal to or slightly larger than post_max_size in php.ini
    fastcgi_buffers 64 4K;

    # Security headers
    add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-Download-Options "noopen" always;
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
    add_header X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies "none" always;
    add_header X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow" always;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
    fastcgi_hide_header X-Powered-By;

    # Pretty URLs and front controller
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$request_uri;
    }

    # Block sensitive paths
    location ~ ^/(?:build|tests|config|lib|3rdparty|templates|data|\.|autotest|occ|issue|indie|db_|console) {
        return 404;
    }

    # PHP handler
    location ~ \.php(?:$|/) {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+?\.php)(/.*)$;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
        fastcgi_param HTTPS on;
        fastcgi_param modHeadersAvailable true;
        fastcgi_param front_controller_active true;
        fastcgi_pass php-handler;
        fastcgi_intercept_errors on;
        fastcgi_request_buffering off;
    }

    # Static files
    location ~ \.(?:css|js|svg|gif|woff2?)$ {
        try_files $uri /index.php$request_uri;
        expires 6M;
        access_log off;
    }

    # DAV client redirect
    location = / {
        if ($http_user_agent ~ ^DavClnt) {
            return 302 /remote.php/webdav/$is_args$args;
        }
    }

    # Redirect /remote
    location /remote {
        return 301 /remote.php$request_uri;
    }

    # robots.txt
    location = /robots.txt {
        allow all;
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
    }

    # MIME types
    include mime.types;
    types {
        text/javascript js mjs;
        application/wasm wasm;
    }

    # Gzip compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_comp_level 4;
    gzip_min_length 256;
    gzip_proxied any;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
}
```

Make sure the file is symlinked to `sites-enabled` so that Nginx loads the site:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Deactivate the `default` site to prevent conflicts and ensure your custom site configuration takes precedence:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

You can validate the configuration file by running:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo nginx -t
```

If no errors occurred you can restart the Nginx service:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Install Nextcloud

Now we can download the latest version of Nextcloud:

```bash {lang=bash}
cd /tmp && wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/latest.zip
```

Unzip the folder and move the folder `nextcloud` to our webserver directory:

```bash {lang=bash}
unzip latest.zip && sudo mv nextcloud /var/www
```

Make the user `www-data`<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> as owner and change the rights for the necessary directories:

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/nextcloud
```

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /mnt/hdd
```

```bash {lang=bash}
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/nextcloud/
```

## Login to Nextcloud

Finally, open your freshly installed Nextcloud web interface by visiting your LXC containerâ€™s IP address, e.g., `http://192.168.1.77`.

Ignore the insecure connection warning for now â€” weâ€™ll secure it with an SSL certificate later.

Create an admin account with a strong password.
Change the data directory to `/mnt/hdd`(or whatever mount point you configured earlier).

For the database connection, enter your `database name`, `username`, `password`, and use `localhost:3306` as the host (because `3306` is the standard port for MariaDB).

Click `Finish` â€” and wait for the installation. This will take a few minutes.

Thatâ€™s it! Your private Nextcloud server is now set up and running on your local network.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
