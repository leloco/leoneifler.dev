The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with legal data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

<br>

Personal data will only be collected when you contact us, e.g., via a contact form. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and why this is done.

<br>

Please note that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication by email) may have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

<br>

<br>

The data controller is the natural or legal person who decides alone or jointly with others on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).

<br>

### Revoking Your Consent to Data Processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email to us is sufficient. The legality of data processing up to the point of revocation remains unaffected.

<br>

Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)
You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.

<br>

If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (objection under Art. 21(1) GDPR).

<br>

If your personal data is processed for direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of data concerning you for such marketing. This also applies to profiling to the extent it is related to such direct marketing. If you object, your data will no longer be used for direct marketing purposes (objection under Art. 21(2) GDPR).

<br>

### Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority

If you believe that your data protection rights have been violated, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in the member state of your habitual residence, workplace, or place of the alleged infringement.

<br>

### Right to Data Portability

You have the right to receive data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only occur where technically feasible.

<br>

### SSL or TLS Encryption

This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries you send to us. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the browser address starting with “https://” and the lock icon in the browser bar.

<br>

When SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit cannot be read by third parties.

<br>

### Access, Deletion, and Correction

Within the scope of applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free access to your stored personal data, their origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing and, if applicable, a right to correct or delete this data.

<br>

### Right to Restrict Processing

You have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this.
<br>

This right exists in the following cases:
<br>

If you contest the accuracy of your stored data, we usually need time to verify this. During the verification period, you have the right to request restriction of processing.
<br>

If the processing is unlawful, you may request restriction instead of deletion.
<br>

If we no longer need the data, but you need it for legal claims, you may request restriction instead of deletion.
<br>

If you have objected under Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of interests must take place. Until it is determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request restriction of processing.
<br>

If the processing of your personal data is restricted, these data may – apart from their storage – only be processed with your consent or for legal claims or the protection of another person or public interest.
