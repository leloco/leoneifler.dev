Liability for Contents
As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general legislation (§ 7 para. 1 TMG). However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

<br>

Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. Any liability in this respect is, however, only possible from the time we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.

Liability for Links
Our website contains links to external third-party websites. We have no influence over the content of these external sites and therefore cannot accept any responsibility for them. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their content.

<br>

The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time the links were created. No illegal content was identifiable at the time. However, ongoing content monitoring of linked pages is not reasonable without specific indications of a legal violation. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
