## Who Am I

Hey! I'm Leon a developer based in Germany &#x1f1e9;&#x1f1ea;

<br>
Over the years, I’ve worn a lot of hats — from testing and frontend work to backend engineering, database tuning, DevOps, and wrangling servers. Each role gave me a new perspective and helped shape how I approach building reliable, scalable systems.
<br>
<br>

## My Passion

Exploring different areas of software development showed me what I really enjoy — and where I want to grow professionally:
</br>

**Data-driven systems — gathering, transforming, and structuring data through well-crafted pipelines and infrastructure.**

<br>
That’s why I’m now focusing my career on data engineering: building pipelines, designing data models, and creating systems that provide value for real world scenarios.<br>
But I think it's more than that. Strong data engineers don’t just think in pipelines and schemas; they think in outcomes, impact, and value.
<br>

<br>

– _Can this system scale — not just technically, but in terms of trust, quality, and long-term maintainability?_

<br>

– _What’s the smartest way here to reduce manual effort and repetitive work?_

<br>

– _Is this the right data to solve the business problem?_

<br>

These questions drive my work — and that’s why I also blog about it: to share what I learn along the way.

<br>

## My Blog

First, there’s nothing better than diving into a technical topic and finding clear, well-structured documentation. That was one of the first lessons my mentors taught me a long time ago — and it stuck. (Thanks, buddies!)

That’s what [my blog](/blog) is about: a place where I document the things I care about, but also a way to give back — by providing the kind of structured guidance I always appreciated.

You won’t just find data topics on my blog. I’m also into home servers, self-hosted apps, secure communication, and home automation — all interconnected setups designed to make daily life easier and have fun with technology.

### For Recruiters

**I welcome opportunities with companies that provide an environment where I can truly thrive.**

<br>

What's important for me:

<br>

- [x] Opportunities in data engineering (full-time)
- [x] Remote-first roles (90% also works)
- [x] English as the primary language (German and Italian are also fine)
- [x] Roles where I can start early and focus on getting things done with an awesome team
- [x] Flexible working hours with essential meetings — no meeting overload
- [x] You’re interested in my meaningful contribution regardless of where I live — location flexibility is important to me, as it may change over time
- [x] A place where I can grow and take ownership — through continuous learning, sharing knowledge with the team, and opportunities to speak or contribute at tech events

<br>

I’m serious about finding the right fit, and if you think I’d be a good match, [I’d love to hear from you](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leon-eifler-9aa9b328a/).
