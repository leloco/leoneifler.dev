## Who Am I

Hey! I'm Leon a developer based in Germany &#x1f1e9;&#x1f1ea;

<br>
Over the years, I’ve worn a lot of hats in my tech career — from testing and frontend work to backend engineering, database tuning, DevOps, and wrangling servers.
<br>
<br>

## My Passion

Exploring different areas and stages of software development showed me what I really enjoy — and where I want to grow professionally: **Working with data.**

<br>
Gathering, transforming, and structuring data through well-crafted pipelines and infrastructure:

<br>
<br>
&#8226; Designing and maintaining scalable data pipelines <br>
&#8226; Building APIs and automation tools <br>
&#8226; Ensuring data quality, observability, and reliability<br>
&#8226; Scripting, CI/CD, and infrastructure as code to ship and maintain data-driven systems at scale<br>

<br>

## My Blog

I love documenting what matters — breaking down complex topics into practical, actionable guides that help others get things done.
<br>
<br>

### For Recruiters

**I welcome opportunities with companies that provide an environment where I can truly thrive.**

What's important for me:

<br>

&#8226; Opportunities in Data Engineering (full-time)<br>

&#8226; Remote-first roles <br>

&#8226; English as the primary language<br>

&#8226; Roles where I can start early and focus on getting things done with an awesome team <br>

&#8226; Flexible working hours with essential meetings — no meeting overload<br>

&#8226; What matters to you is the impact I make — not where I’m located <br>

&#8226; A place to grow through ownership, continuous learning, and sharing — with opportunities to contribute beyond the team<br>
